    "# AQI Data For Redmond, Oregon\n",
    "---\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to gather historical Air Quality Index (AQI) data for Redmond, Oregon, which is located in Deschutes County from May 1st through October 31 from 1963 onwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we use the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality Service (AQS) API, which is a historical API and does not provide real-time air quality data. The [documentation](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html) for the API provides definitions of the different call parameter and examples of the various calls that can be made to the API. Additional information on the Air Quality System can be found in the [EPA FAQ](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/frequent-questions-about-airdata).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Air Quality Index is a measure designed to tell us how healthy the air is on any given day and is commonly used to track pollutants such as smog or smoke. Generally, a rating of 0-50 indicates healthy, clean air, while 500 is the highest tracked value for hazardous air. A thorough explanation of how AQI is calculated can be found [here](https://www.airnow.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/aqi-technical-assistance-document-sept2018.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding nearby monitoring stations requires the Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS)\n",
    "of the desired city, county, and state. Information was gathered from [here](https://www.census.gov/library/reference/code-lists/ansi.html#cou). The FIPS values used in this notebook are as follows:\n",
    "* State: 41\n",
    "* County: 017\n",
    "\n",
    "This format, the 5 digit string, is a 'old' format that is still widely used. "
